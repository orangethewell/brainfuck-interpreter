# brainfuck-interpreter
This is just another brainfuck interpreter implemented in C. But will be something a little more interessing in the future! Maybe...

## How to use
Just compile everything in a `bff` executable in your PC with gcc (or a compiler of your preference) and execute your brainfuck code with:

```
bff my_delicious_code.bf
```
